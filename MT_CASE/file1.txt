Topic 5

The SP elective framework offers students options to pursue their passion and/or meet different career needs, and is an integral part of the holistic education we seek to provide to our students. The learning experiences of this elective framework help students in their development as self-directed, versatile, lifelong learners, which are essential in today-s volatile and changing societal as well as occupational landscape. Students who are interested to explore additional new skills and abilities will have the opportunity to take up to five electives. Certificates and minors will be awarded when students complete a suite of related elective.
